# Orizuru

Project that powers this website. Anyone can use it if they like.

## Motivation

I've always liked to share knowledge and create things. Thus, the idea of having my own website came to mind. At first I explored multiple tools, such as Wordpress, Ghost, Google pages, and others.
However, I always felt something was missing. Either flexibility, performance, minimalism or simplicity.

Thus, I had to create something of my own. Something to fullfil my custom needs. On the other hand, would be a great project to practice, learn and keep up to date.

## Requirements

I indentified the following requirements for the website as `must` have:

-   Fast loading times.
-   Able to handle blog style posts and comments.
-   Clean styling.
-   Customizable components.
-   Good SEO.
-   Javascript based.

## Technology selection

### Next.js
